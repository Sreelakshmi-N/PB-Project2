The main objective of this project is analyzing the twitter data about ‘Politics’ category and analyze the data using Hadoop MapReduce. After collecting, the necessary tweets data we have used python code to retrieve text from the tweets. Based on the text we have calculated the list of words in the tweets text file which includes the list of duplicates and unique words in the tweets text file using MapReduce program and also calculated the ratio of number of unique words and to the number of duplicate words. We also implemented MapReduce program to return the top ten best times to post a tweet on twitter.
